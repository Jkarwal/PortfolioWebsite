          My name is Joey Karwal and this is a Wikipedia article on Italian
          Unification in the 19th century.
        </p>
        <p>
          Italian unification (Italian: Unità d'Italia [uniˈta ddiˈtaːlja]),
          also known as the Risorgimento (/rɪˌsɔːrdʒɪˈmɛntoʊ/, Italian:
          [risordʒiˈmento]; meaning "the Resurgence"), was the political and
          social movement that consolidated different states of the Italian
          peninsula into the single state of the Kingdom of Italy in the 19th
          century. The process began in 1815 with the Congress of Vienna and was
          completed in 1871 when Rome became the capital of the Kingdom of
          Italy.

          The term, which also designates the cultural, political and social
          movement that promoted unification, recalls the romantic, nationalist
          and patriotic ideals of an Italian renaissance through the conquest of
          a unified political identity that, by sinking its ancient roots during
          the Roman period, "suffered an abrupt halt [or loss] of its political
          unity in 476 AD after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire".[3]
          However, some of the terre irredente did not join the Kingdom of Italy
          until 1918 after Italy defeated Austria–Hungary in World War I. For
          this reason, sometimes the period is extended to include the late
          19th-century and the First World War (1915–1918), until the 4 November
          1918 Armistice of Villa Giusti, which is considered the completion of
          unification. This view is followed, for example, at the Central Museum
          of Risorgimento at the Vittoriano.
